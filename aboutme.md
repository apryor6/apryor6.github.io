title: About me
subtitle: Data scientist, physicist, HPC software engineer

My name is AJ, and I am currently a graduate student in the 5th and final year of my physics Ph.D at UCLA. My research in the [Coherent Imaging Group](http://www.physics.ucla.edu/research/imaging/) focuses on developing, implementing, and accelerating 2D image simulation and 3D reconstruction algorithms. I am extremely interested in all aspects of high-performance computing (HPC) and particularly how the interplay of HPC techniques and mathematics may be used to solve real-world problems in ways that were previously unrealizable. I've developed novel algorithms, implemented/accelerated existing ones into scalable, parallel computing solutions on hardware including supercomputers and GPUs, and put such tools into the hands of others by developing graphical user interfaces and easy-to-use software packages. I am passionate about connecting with people and communicating the implications of the sometimes murky nature of data in ways that are meaningful. It is this crossroads of mathematics, cutting-edge computing, and human interaction that made data science a natural progression for me from academia to industry, and I consider myself very fortunate to be doing what I love every day.  

I do have other interests besides work. Saturdays are for fishing and football. I play the guitar or piano more days than not. I try to be a good home-cook, and I love spending as much time as possible with my wife and our daughter.
