subtitle: Data scientist, physicist, HPC software engineer

My name is AJ, and I would call myself an end-to-end data scientist and full-stack developer. My interests and skillset cover the spectrum from database administration to machine learning to full stack web application development, and I specialize in creating fully-formed data-driven applications for the purpose of solving challenging problems and driving business value.

My current role is Principal Data Scientist at American Tire Distributors (ATD), where I am a member of the Advanced Analytics Center of Excellence. ATD is the largest distributor of replacement tires in the world, and my job focuses on finding ways to use data science and analytics to improve sales, merchandising, supply chain, finance, and other core aspects of the business.

My Ph.D. research in the [Coherent Imaging Group](http://www.physics.ucla.edu/research/imaging/) focused on developing, implementing, and accelerating 2D image simulation and 3D reconstruction algorithms. I am extremely interested in all aspects of high-performance computing (HPC) and particularly how the interplay of HPC techniques and mathematics may be used to solve real-world problems in ways that were previously unrealizable. I've developed novel algorithms, implemented/accelerated existing ones into scalable, parallel computing solutions on hardware including supercomputers and GPUs, and put such tools into the hands of others by developing graphical user interfaces and easy-to-use software packages. I am passionate about connecting with people and communicating the implications of the sometimes murky nature of data in ways that are meaningful. It is this crossroads of mathematics, cutting-edge computing, and human interaction that made data science a natural progression for me from academia to industry, and I consider myself very fortunate to be doing what I love every day.

I do have other interests besides work. Saturdays are mostly for fishing or football, depending on the time of year. I play the guitar or piano more days than not. I try to be a good home-cook, and I love spending as much time as possible with my wife and our daughter.
